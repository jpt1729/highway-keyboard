Been working on this for a little bit working on the schematic. One thing that happened the last time I designed this is I would delete random switches which would mess up the numbering so I am not doing that now!!!. 

I have designed out the PCB and the Schematic (only the keys so far) and have decided to go with a pico. 

Got pretty far but realized I was building an inverted keyboard which is exactly waht I don't want
