Been working on this for a little bit working on the schematic. One thing that happened the last time I designed this is I would delete random switches which would mess up the numbering so I am not doing that now!!!. 

I have designed out the PCB and the Schematic (only the keys so far) and have decided to go with a pico. 

Got pretty far but realized I was building an inverted keyboard which is exactly what I don't want. Fixed it and placed the LEDs

I've been working some more on the project. I made a couple of mistakes, but now they are fixed. The LEDs in the PCB are wired and so are the diodes. Working on connecting everything so that I can start adding the smaller bits and pieces to the PCB (art, screw holes, rounded corners, etc.). So far its looking really good. The LEDs are gunna be hard to solder but I should be good.

I got the keyboard basically all wired up I just need the columns and to wire up the ec11 and we gooooooddddd.

Ok so now we are almost done! So I finished the PCB I decided to go with chamfered edges instead of rounded corners cause I feel like it will look cooler with the case. I want a case with a skeletal design.

Today, I finished wiring up everything putting the screws and all the stabalizers.

Hours spent: 1.5 hrs

Today I want to finish the project which means case design + firmware + art on pcb.

Starting with the Art on the PCB.
